## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Haiii!!! My name is Tim and I am a first year Mathematical and Computer Sciences student studying at the University of Adelaide. I hope to add more to my portfolio.....especially with my website, but other than that, I am very interested in data science. I also have a high ambition to study postgraduate Medicine, and have an interdisciplinary expertise in both computer science and medicine.
